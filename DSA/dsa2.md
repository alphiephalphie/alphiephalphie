- Prompt: "Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target."
- Signal: Need to find complements—suggesting a hash table approach.
- Test-First? Yes – Clear I/O makes tests straightforward.

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Find indices of two numbers that add up to target.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers
        target: Target sum
        
    Returns:
        List containing indices of the two numbers
        
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    """
    complement_map = {}  # val -> index
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in complement_map:
            return [complement_map[complement], i]
        complement_map[num] = i
    
    return []  # No solution found
```

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Find the length of longest substring without repeating characters.
    
    Args:
        s: Input string
        
    Returns:
        Length of longest substring without repeating characters
        
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(min(m,n)) where m is alphabet size
    """
    char_dict = {}  # char -> last position
    start = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for end, char in enumerate(s):
        # If char already in current window, move start pointer
        if char in char_dict and char_dict[char] >= start:
            start = char_dict[char] + 1
        else:

        char_dict[char] = end
    
    return max_length
```

**Advanced Techniques:**

    while l1 or l2 or carry:
        # Get values from lists or 0 if list exhausted
        x = l1.val if l1 else 0
        y = l2.val if l2 else 0
        
        # Calculate sum and carry
        total = x + y + carry
        carry = total // 10
        
        # Create new node with digit
        current.next = ListNode(total % 10)
        current = current.next
        
        # Advance list pointers
        l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
        l2 = l2.next if l2 else None
    
    return dummy_head.next
```

    Returns:
        Head of the reversed linked list
        
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    """
    prev = None
    current = head
    
    while current:
        next_temp = current.next  # Store next node
        current.next = prev       # Reverse link
        prev = current            # Move prev forward
        current = next_temp       # Move current forward
    
    return prev  # New head is the last node
```

    """
    Find node where two linked lists intersect.
    
    Args:
        headA: Head of first linked list
        headB: Head of second linked list
        
    Returns:
        Intersection node or None
        
    Time Complexity: O(m+n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    """
    if not headA or not headB:
        return None
        
    ptrA, ptrB = headA, headB
    
    # When pointers meet, they'll be at intersection or both None
    while ptrA != ptrB:

2. **Write test cases** - Cover normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions
3. **Implement minimally** - Write just enough code to pass tests
4. **Refactor** - Improve implementation while maintaining test coverage
5. **Optimize** - Address performance concerns with benchmarks

## 6. Test-Driven Development Implementation

### 6.1 Testing Infrastructure Framework

The strategic implementation of test-driven development requires a systematic approach to test infrastructure:

    E --> F[Refactor Implementation]
    F --> G[Verify Tests Still Pass]
    G --> H[Add Edge-Case Tests]
    H --> C
```

#### Structured Test Development Evolution

The iterative development of test-driven solutions follows a predictable pattern of increasing sophistication:

**Stage 1: Initial Test Framework**
```python
import unittest

class TestTwoSum(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_basic_case(self):
        """Test the two_sum function with a simple valid input."""
        self.assertEqual(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9), [0, 1])
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**Stage 2: Implementation Stub**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Find indices of two numbers that add up to target.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers
        target: Target sum
        
    Returns:
        List containing indices of the two numbers
    """
    # Placeholder implementation
    return []
```

**Stage 3: Comprehensive Test Suite**
```python
import unittest
from two_sum import two_sum

class TestTwoSum(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_basic_case(self):
        """Test with a simple valid input."""
        self.assertEqual(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9), [0, 1])
    
    def test_alternative_order(self):
        """Test with numbers not in sorted order."""
        result = two_sum([3, 2, 4], 6)
        self.assertIn(result, [[1, 2], [2, 1]])
    
    def test_duplicate_numbers(self):
        """Test with duplicate numbers in the array."""
        self.assertEqual(two_sum([3, 3], 6), [0, 1])
    
    def test_negative_numbers(self):
        """Test with negative numbers in the array."""
        result = two_sum([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], -8)
        self.assertIn(result, [[2, 4], [4, 2]])
    
    def test_no_solution(self):
        """Test when no solution exists."""
        self.assertEqual(two_sum([1, 2, 3], 7), [])
    
    def test_zero_sum(self):
        """Test with zero as the target sum."""
        result = two_sum([-1, 0, 1], 0)
        self.assertIn(result, [[0, 2], [2, 0]])
    
    def test_large_array(self):
        """Test with a larger array to check performance."""
        large_array = list(range(10000))
        large_array[5000] = 5
        large_array[9000] = 9995
        result = two_sum(large_array, 10000)
        self.assertIn(result, [[5000, 9000], [9000, 5000]])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**Stage 4: Initial Implementation**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Find indices of two numbers that add up to target.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers

    Returns:
        List containing indices of the two numbers
        
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    """
    complement_map = {}  # value -> index
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in complement_map:
            return [complement_map[complement], i]
        complement_map[num] = i
    
    return []  # No solution found
```

**Stage 5: Optimized Implementation with Performance Analysis**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Find indices of two numbers that add up to target.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers
        target: Target sum
        
    Returns:
        List containing indices of the two numbers
        
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    """
    if not nums or len(nums) < 2:
        return []
    
    # Early optimization: if array is too small
    if len(nums) == 2:
        return [0, 1] if nums[0] + nums[1] == target else []
    
    complement_map = {}  # value -> index
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in complement_map:
            return [complement_map[complement], i]
        complement_map[num] = i
    
    return []  # No solution found
```

#### Test Execution Tools and Reporting

Strategic test execution incorporates automated tools for consistent quality:

```python
# test_runner.py
import unittest
import time
import sys
from io import StringIO
from contextlib import redirect_stdout

def run_tests(test_module):
    """
    Run tests with detailed reporting.
    
    Args:
        test_module: Module containing unittest test cases
    """
    # Capture start time
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Create test suite and runner
    loader = unittest.TestLoader()
    suite = loader.loadTestsFromModule(test_module)
    
    # Capture output
    output = StringIO()
    with redirect_stdout(output):
        result = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2).run(suite)
    
    # Execution time
    execution_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Generate report
    passed = result.testsRun - (len(result.errors) + len(result.failures))
    
    print(f"\n{'=' * 50}")
    print(f"TEST EXECUTION REPORT")
    print(f"{'=' * 50}")
    print(f"Total tests: {result.testsRun}")
    print(f"Passed: {passed}")
    print(f"Failed: {len(result.failures)}")
    print(f"Errors: {len(result.errors)}")
    print(f"Execution time: {execution_time:.4f} seconds")
    print(f"{'=' * 50}")
    
    # Show failed tests with details
    if result.failures or result.errors:
        print("\nFAILED TESTS:")
        for test, error in result.failures:
            print(f"\n{test}")
            print(f"ERROR: {error}")
        
        for test, error in result.errors:
            print(f"\n{test}")
            print(f"ERROR: {error}")
    
    return passed == result.testsRun

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import test_two_sum
    success = run_tests(test_two_sum)
    sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```

### 6.2 Test Case Strategy Framework

A rigorous test-driven development approach requires systematic test case formulation:

| Test Case Category | Purpose | Implementation Strategy | Validation Approach |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Happy Path | Verify primary functionality | Use typical valid inputs | Assert expected output exactly |
| Edge Cases | Test boundary conditions | Zero values, empty inputs, minimal valid inputs | Assert handling of special conditions |
| Error Cases | Validate error handling | Invalid, malformed, or illegal inputs | Assert appropriate error responses |
| Performance Cases | Evaluate efficiency | Large inputs, worst-case scenarios | Assert time-bounded execution |
| Regression Cases | Prevent reintroduction of fixed bugs | Previously failed inputs | Assert correct handling of specific inputs |

#### Case Study: Test Suite for Binary Search

```python
import unittest
from binary_search import binary_search

class TestBinarySearch(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_array(self):
        """Test with an empty array."""

    def test_multiple_elements_found_end(self):
        """Test with multiple elements, target at end."""

    def test_multiple_elements_not_found_above_range(self):
        """Test with multiple elements, target above range."""

    def test_large_array(self):
        """Test with a large array, target in middle."""

        self.assertLess(execution_time, 0.01)  # Should be very fast

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### 6.3 Progressive Test Development

The implementation of test-driven development evolves through distinct phases, each adding value:

**Phase 1: Specification Tests**
Focus on documenting requirements through tests before implementation begins.

```python
def test_specifications():
    """
    Run assertion tests based on functional specifications.
    These initial tests define requirements before implementation.
    """
    # Interface contract validation
    assert callable(two_sum), "two_sum should be a callable function"
    
    # Input parameter validation
    try:
        two_sum([], 0)  # Should accept empty array
        two_sum([1], 1)  # Should accept single-element array
        two_sum([1, 2], 3)  # Should accept multi-element array
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"two_sum should accept valid inputs: {str(e)}"
    
    # Output contract validation
    result = two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
    assert isinstance(result, list), "Output should be a list"
    assert all(isinstance(x, int) for x in result), "Output should contain integers"
```

**Phase 2: Behavioral Tests**
Extend testing to validate behavior across various scenarios.

```python
def test_behavior():
    """
    Test the function's behavior across different scenarios.
    These tests ensure the implementation meets requirements.
    """
    # Basic functionality
    assert two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) == [0, 1], "Should find correct indices"
    
    # Edge cases
    assert two_sum([], 1) == [], "Empty array should return empty result"
    assert two_sum([1], 1) == [], "Single element can't sum with itself"
    
    # No solution exists
    assert two_sum([1, 2, 3], 10) == [], "Should return empty list when no solution"
    
    # Multiple potential solutions (only need to return one)
    result = two_sum([3, 2, 4, 3], 6)
    assert result in ([0, 3], [3, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]), "Should find a valid solution"
```

**Phase 3: Implementation Tests**
Comprehensive tests that validate the full implementation including optimizations.

```python
class TestTwoSumImplementation(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Comprehensive test suite for the two_sum implementation.
    """
    
    def test_correctness(self):
        """Test basic correctness across various inputs."""
        test_cases = [
            {"input": {"nums": [2, 7, 11, 15], "target": 9}, "expected": [0, 1]},
            {"input": {"nums": [3, 2, 4], "target": 6}, "expected": [1, 2]},
            {"input": {"nums": [3, 3], "target": 6}, "expected": [0, 1]},
            {"input": {"nums": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "target": 9}, "expected": [3, 4]},
            {"input": {"nums": [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], "target": -8}, "expected": [2, 4]}
        ]
        
        for case in test_cases:
            result = two_sum(**case["input"])
            self.assertEqual(result, case["expected"])
    
    def test_no_solution(self):
        """Test cases where no solution exists."""
        no_solution_cases = [
            {"nums": [1, 2, 3], "target": 10},
            {"nums": [], "target": 5},
            {"nums": [5], "target": 5}
        ]
        
        for case in no_solution_cases:
            self.assertEqual(two_sum(**case), [])
    
    def test_performance(self):
        """Test performance on large inputs."""
        # Generate large test case
        large_array = list(range(100000))
        large_array[50000] = 1
        large_array[99999] = 100000
        
        # Measure execution time
        start_time = time.time()
        result = two_sum(large_array, 100001)
        execution_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        # Verify correctness
        self.assertEqual(result, [50000, 99999])
        
        # Verify performance (should be fast with hash map)
        self.assertLess(execution_time, 0.1, 
                         "Implementation should handle large arrays efficiently")
```
