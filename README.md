# üëãüèº Hey, I'm Alphonso
Platform/Product Engineer who notices what's missing and builds it, architecting solutions that make the complex simple. Cloud, web, or mobile, I build for humans. 

## What I'm building:
**@ Work:** Founding engineer of multiple teams building data platforms and tooling that let business teams focus on their customers instead of fighting infrastructure.

**@ Home:** Apps for real life - AI-enhanced journaling, music production tools, automating the boring stuff

- **Ritmo** - Open source music platform for culture fans (think Spotify meets community curation) with Ritmo Pro for producers - cloud project management, DAW-agnostic workflows, background bouncing, and eliminating rote production tasks
- **Chronikle** - An AI-enhanced personal knowledge system that combines journaling with intelligent insights. Privacy-focused design, on-device AI, rich media support (music, locations, web content), and seamless Apple ecosystem integration 
- **[RxVision](https://github.com/alphiephalphie/RxVision)** - End-to-end ML pipeline for medical image classification (93% accuracy)
